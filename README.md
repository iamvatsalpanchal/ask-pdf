# 📚 Ask-PDF - RAG Streamlit Application
Open-source LLM-based PDF Chat streamlit application
This application allows you to upload PDF documents, create a knowledge base from their contents, and ask questions related to the content using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. 
It provides concise answers based on the PDF's contents.

## ✨ Features
- 🗂️ Upload PDFs: Easily upload your PDF files to create a searchable knowledge base.
- 💾 Persistent Storage: Stores the PDF embeddings for later use.
- 🤖 Question Answering: Ask questions related to the content of the uploaded PDFs and receive concise answers generated by the AI model.
- 🛠️ Modular Design: Clean and modular code structure for easy maintenance and extension.

## About the App
This application allows you to upload PDF documents and create a knowledge base or vector store from them. 
You can then ask questions based on the content of the PDFs, and the app will provide concise answers using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model.
